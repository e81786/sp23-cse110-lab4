# Part 1

1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. Error, because a `let` declaration means that `result` is only accessible within it's block scope, so it cannot be accessed outside of the `if` statement.
5. Error, because the `const` keyword means that the varaible cannot be reassigned, so when the code gets to `result = num1 + num2`, it runs into an error as `result` is a `const`, so it cannot be reassigned.
6. Error, for the same reason as #5.
